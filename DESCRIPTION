Description: This package allows multinomial regression on large datasets by splitting up the multinomial model with M output categories into M-1 binomial models and estimating each one separately. The VC matrix of the parameter estimates is computed as in Begg & Gray, 1984. It is especially designed for the analysis of large mutation datasets from cancer genomes. The package was written for the data analysis in the paper Bertl, J.; Guo, Q. et al. bioRxiv, 2017. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/122879.
