\description{
The dataset contains mutated and non-mutated genomic positions obtained from tumor samples from 505 cancer patients (see Source). The dataset consists of a random sample of genomic positions that cover around 0.4\% of the genome. The data is formatted for multinomial regression analysis of the mutation rate.
}
\details{
The genomic positions are classified according to the following genomic properties: expression level, phyloP score, replication timing, strong site, CpG site, apobec site, neighboring sites (see Format for details). For each type of position, the number of mutations (YES) and the number of non-mutated positions (NO) per sample are counted. In addition, different types of mutations are counted, assuming strand-symmetry: I (transition), VA (transversion to an A:T basepair), VG (transversion to a G:C basepair). Only single-nucleotide variants are considered.

The genomic properties expression, phyloP score and replication timing are originally measured on a (pseudo-)continuous scale. Here, they are binned by quintiles and the quintile means are used. For the expression level, this is done seperately for each cancer type.

The data is not sorted to avoid that subset of the data consisting of subsequent lines contain only very few factor levels.
